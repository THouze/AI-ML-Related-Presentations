# AI-ML-Related-Presentations
Hello, 

Welcome to my Git Hub site. For your convenience, I have embedded an audio track to the presentation titled "A Bibliometric Portfolio Analysis.” I recommend it as the first presentation since it is a slide show with audio. 

If you want to listen to the slide show as it automatically progresses, please select the "Slide Show" icon on the lower right-hand side at the bottom of the screen directly left and adjacent to the slider icon at the extreme right at the bottom of the screen.

Please enjoy this and all of the other presentations and Jupyter Notebooks in other folders, and if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact me.

Thank you,

Thomas Houze
