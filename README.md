# AI-ML-Related-Presentations

Hello, 

Welcome to my Git Hub site. For your convenience, I have embedded an audio track to the presentation titled "A Bibliometric Portfolio Analysis.” I recommend it as the first presentation since it is a slide show with audio. 

If you want to listen to the slide show as it automatically progresses, please select the "Slide Show" icon on the lower right-hand side at the bottom of the screen directly left and adjacent to the slider icon at the extreme right at the bottom of the screen.

Please enjoy these presentations, and if interested and able to access Jupyter Notebooks, please visit my root directory, please click on "THouze" in the upper left corner of the Git Hub display, to access some examples of various examples of AI/ML in Jupyter Notebooks in the folders present in the root directory, and if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact me.

Thank you,

Thomas Houze
